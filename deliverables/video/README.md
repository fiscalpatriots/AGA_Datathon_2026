# Video Deliverable

This folder holds documentation for the video deliverable.

## Plan
- Final video file is typically too large for standard GitHub pushes.
- If stored in GitHub, use Git LFS on an archive branch.
- If stored externally (Drive/OneDrive), link it here.

## Status
- Video not added to main yet.
